Transition probability initialization
look at task-spec from agent-init
look at agent-step function

Reward function definition
I believe its in env-init implementation

How to solve optimal control/policy evaluation problem

**************
IMPORTANT DATA
**************
task-spec - observation info, episodic/continuous, state space, action space
buffer - has rewards, observations, actions..buffers may be distinct
lookup-table - agents (Q)value function!!
actions-table - agent's action space
